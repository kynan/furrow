    <h2>Furrow</h2>
    <p>Some things are not for sharing. Not with everyone, anyway.</p>
    <p>But it might be nice (or useful) to share memories with those closest to you, or be able to contact just your closest friends.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A restricted, private network for your most trusted and intimate family and friends.</li>
      <li>A way to easily invite your mates over for tea</li>
      <li>A lifeline when you’re in danger and don’t want to call 999</li>
      <li>A secure means to share cherished moments with your Dad who has Alzheimer’s…</li>
      <li>… and for your Dad to keep alive his memories, nurtured by the ones who love him most.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Most of all</h2>
    <p>Furrow is a network that embeds</p>
    <ul><li>trust,</li><li>intimacy, and</li><li>privacy.</li>
    <p>It is a platform that others can build on top of to embed trusted social functionality in their apps.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="slide">
    <h2>So&hellip;</h2>
    <p>It’s no substitute for visiting, but Furrow could keep residents with busy relatives mentally active and help stave off feelings of loneliness and depression.</p>
    <p>Since not every care home resident has an iPad and free wifi, Furrow will be able to send relatives’ updates to the care home manager by email or PDF to print out, and eventually updates could be sent by post!</p>
    <p>The aim is to make it easy for relatives to send updates using what they’re used to—apps, tablets and gizmos—and also easy for residents to keep in touch using old technologies: the friendly local postie.</p>
